As I crawl back into the VHDL world from 13 years of strictly software design
this shitty blog will cover what I'm currently learning.  Strangely, not much
has changed in the hardware design world.  I'm hoping I can bring some of the
software design crap that I learned over the last decade.  Who knows??  I find
hardware people resist software tooling but I think if they were to open their
minds a bit they might discover some of the tools like `tcl`, `git` or `make` valuable in
their environment. **Fuck, who knows...**

Chad Bearden, here.  I have:

* Designed Image Processing hardware for daVinci Systems, now [Black Magic Design](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com)
* Partnered in a startup called AtLightSpeed, Inc. We made a plugin board for an
  SGI workstation that had fuck loads of FPGAs that was a reconfigurable computer
  that accelerated image processing algorithms.
* Taught VHDL for Esperan, Ltd., now [Cadence](https://www.cadence.com)
* Contracted for da Vinci Systems for some more hardware design.
* Quit all my jobs sold my house bought a VW Vanagon and toured around the USA
  for 18 months and lived in England for 18 months.
* Worked with a great group of people and designed a piece of software that helped manage dental residents at Lutheran
  Medical Center in Brooklyn NY, now [NYU Langone Dental](http://www.lmcdental.org)
* Pissed off NYU Langone and was told to fuck off. :)
* Retired 47.
* Currently teaching VHDL about 1 week a month for [Doulos](https://www.doulos.com)
